            I've been playing volleyball since I was twelve years old. I could just never get enough
            of it. I would spend my freetime in my backyard setting the ball against the house wall
            or watching professional volleyball highlights on youtube. Even to this day, I play
            several times a week and it is one of biggest sources of fun, stress-relief, and social
            interaction.

            Volleyball comes in three main types of flavors: Court, Sand, and Grass. Usually, sand
            and grass volleyball are 2v2 while court volleyball is 6v6. While the same basic skills
            are important for all of them, each has its own specific challenges that makes it hard for
            someone who has only played one of the versions to go and do well in the others right off
            the bat.
